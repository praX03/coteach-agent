# Assignment: AI Tutor with Agent-Based Infrastructure

This project is an AI chatbot API that is capable of ingesting images or text from a user. The chatbot fetches accurate YouTube links and responds to the user while answering their query on the chat.

## Problem Statement

The goal is to build a chatbot API that can handle both text and image-based queries. The chatbot should provide real YouTube video links to clarify certain topics when needed. This should be done using APIs, not generated by the LLM. The chatbot should also have a memory so a conversation can take place. The memory could be DB based or buffer based.

## Requirements

- [x] 1. The bot should be able to respond to both text and image-based queries.
- [x] 2. The bot should provide real YouTube video links to clarify certain topics when needed - this should be done using APIs (and not generated by the LLM).
- [x] 3. The bot should have a memory so a conversation can take place. (No requirements for the kind of memory - could be DB based or buffer based).
- [x] 4. For the major LLMs used, consider using OpenAI models.
- [x] 5. Consider using existing frameworks instead of building one yourself.
- [x] 6. [Hint/Optional] The bot should follow an agent-based infrastructure - where a base model has the ability to use “tools” that could include vision capabilities i.e. in this case, call the GPT-4V model and YouTube capabilities i.e. in this case, call YouTube search APIs - the params for which can be gathered directly from the base model or from a smaller model.

## Instructions

- Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
source ./.venv/bin/activate
```

- Run the following command to install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Run the following command to start the Flask server:

```bash
python app.py
```

Server starts listening on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
You can make `POST` requests to the server using the following endpoint:

```bash
http://127.0.0.1:5000/chat
```

Body of the request should be in the following format:

```json
{
    "message": "Your message goes here"
}
```

You can pass **image** to chat by updating image url in the following format:

```json
{
    "message": "Your message goes here. ![image-text](iamge-url)"
}
```

*Alternatively*, you can use the following command to run the agent independently:

```bash
python main.py
```
